# [Crev Proof Repository](https://github.com/crev-dev/crev/wiki/Proof-Repository)

I'm trying out the [`crev`](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev) code review system for Rust dependencies. This repo will contain public reviews.

My reviews are not particularly in-depth; I am primarily trying to make it so that the packages I want to use are reviewed *at all*.
My minimum standard for publishing a review is that I've read every line of the package and am confident that there is no code that is either malicious or significantly inappropriate in context (e.g. network access in a library that purports to only implement algorithms). Beyond that, I will report whatever I noticed about the quality of the code.
