comment: |-
  I have reviewed the code for reasonableness, not correctness. It is
  generally straightforward, though in a somewhat unusual style with
  a lot of absolute paths.
  
  There is one `unsafe` code block, which is sound but unnecessary.
  
  I have been successfully using this library to write STL files.
  I have not tested it for reading STL files.
