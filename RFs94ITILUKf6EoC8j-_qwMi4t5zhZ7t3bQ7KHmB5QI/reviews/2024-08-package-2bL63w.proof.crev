  I have reviewed the code for reasonableness, not correctness. It is
  generally straightforward, though in a somewhat unusual style with
  a lot of absolute paths.
  
  There is one `unsafe` code block, which is sound but unnecessary.
  
  I have been successfully using this library to write STL files.
  I have not tested it for reading STL files.

  The license information is somewhat inconsistent, as it contains three
  license text files (GPL, Apache, and MIT) but the `Cargo.toml`
  specifies `license = "Apache-2.0 OR MIT"`.

  Compared to the previous version I reviewed, 0.7.0,
  
  * There are no code changes (odd).
  * There is no changelog.
  * The license information has been clarified, but it is no longer
    under the Apache-2.0 license, only MIT.
