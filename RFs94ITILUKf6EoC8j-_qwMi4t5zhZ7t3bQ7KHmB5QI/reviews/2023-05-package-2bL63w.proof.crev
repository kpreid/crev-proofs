  Extremely simple crate providing useful trait aliases. The code consists
  solely of macro-generated `trait`s and `impl`s; other than the `macro_rules`
  macro itself, all of the crateâ€™s definition is visible in its documentation.
  If there were a bug, the worst consequence would likely be dependents failing
  to compile, since none of the code is statements or expressions to execute
  at run time.

  This proc-macro crate defines an attribute macro `#[mutants::skip]` which
  always returns its input unchanged (i.e. the attribute has no effect).
  
  The attribute is detected by the `cargo-mutants` tool when it parses source
  code. It should be completely safe and have no effect unless you are using
  `cargo-mutants` (which this is not a review of).

  Contains no unsafe code. Contains no IO. Straightforward and well organized
  code, though the number of different cases and scenarios it handles makes
  it daunting to thoroughly comprehend. Well commented. Extensive tests.
  
  I have not reviewed the correctness of the algorithms or their resistance
  to DoS attacks (i.e. whether they can enter infinite loops or over-allocate).
  I have examined each line to check that it is not obviously malicious or
  obfuscated.
