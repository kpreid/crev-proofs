  Extremely simple crate providing useful trait aliases. The code consists
  solely of macro-generated `trait`s and `impl`s; other than the `macro_rules`
  macro itself, all of the crateâ€™s definition is visible in its documentation.
  If there were a bug, the worst consequence would likely be dependents failing
  to compile, since none of the code is statements or expressions to execute
  at run time.
